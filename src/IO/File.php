     *  <p>
     *  Different operating system families have different line-ending
     *  conventions. When you write a text file and want to insert a line
     *  break, you need to use the correct line-ending character(s) for your
     *  operating system. Unix based systems use \n as the
     *  line ending character, Windows based systems use \r\n
     *  as the line ending characters and Macintosh based systems use
     *  \r as the line ending character.
     *  </p>
     *  <p>
     *  If you use the wrong line ending characters when writing your files, you
     *  might find that other applications that open those files will "look
     *  funny".
     *  </p>
     *  <p>
     *  Windows offers a text-mode translation flag ('t')
     *  which will transparently translate \n to
     *  \r\n when working with the file. In contrast, you
     *  can also use 'b' to force binary mode, which will not
     *  translate your data. To use these flags, specify either
     *  'b' or 't' as the last character
     *  of the mode parameter.
     *  </p>
     *  <p>
     *  The default translation mode depends on the SAPI and version of PHP that
     *  you are using, so you are encouraged to always specify the appropriate
     *  flag for portability reasons. You should use the 't'
     *  mode if you are working with plain-text files and you use
     *  \n to delimit your line endings in your script, but
     *  expect your files to be readable with applications such as notepad. You
     *  should use the 'b' in all other cases.
     *  </p>
     *  <p>
     *  If you do not specify the 'b' flag when working with binary files, you
     *  may experience strange problems with your data, including broken image
     *  files and strange problems with \r\n characters.
     *  </p>
     *  <p>
     *  For portability, it is strongly recommended that you always
     *  use the 'b' flag when opening files with fopen.
     *  </p>
     *  <p>
     *  Again, for portability, it is also strongly recommended that
     *  you re-write code that uses or relies upon the 't'
     *  mode so that it uses the correct line endings and
     *  'b' mode instead.
